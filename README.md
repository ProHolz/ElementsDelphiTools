# Element Delphi Tools
Part of the RTL2 project, a collection of Tools for using with Remobject-Elements
https://www.elementscompiler.com

The goal is to have some Tools helping to port large Delphi-Projects to Elements.
First step was to bring in the Delphi-Ast Toolset to Elements.
[DelphiAST](https://github.com/RomanYankovsky/DelphiAST)

you will find it in the PascalParser subfolder.

## What will be in here?

1. Delphi AST aka PascalParser (done)
1. Problem Checker,
   Tool to find Problems in Delphi-Sources before porting to Elements (done)
1. Test-Creator, a Tool to create Test-Classes for all public classes and public methods in Delphi-Sources. (WIP)
