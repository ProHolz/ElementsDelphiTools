# CodeGenerator

CodeGenerator is an open source cross-platform, language agnostic code generation engine that will
drive the code generation for the ProHolz-Elements Tools.
It is a Clone from the Remobjects [CodeGen4](https://github.com/remobjects/CodeGen4). It is a Clone because the needs of the Tools are different.

Currently in very early prototype stage, and not ready for consumption, just yet.
But feedback and contributions are welcome.

Implemented in Swift with [RemObjects Silver](http://elementscompiler.com/silver).

## Platform support:

CodeGenerator can be used *on* (i.e. linked into tools written for) the following platforms:

* .NET, Cocoa and Java, via the [Elements](http://elementscompiler.com) compiler

## Language Support

* Oxygene _(mostly done)_
